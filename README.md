# AI-Searches
Employs DFS, DFS Iterative, BFS, Best First Search to traverse through a Binary Tree

Uses made up city distances to test the algorithms (thus the heuristic for the city used in best first search is not good)

Uses a node that holds each city object to create the binary tree

Drivers for the various searches are in the files ending with the name "driver"
